This dataset contains data generated from ten days of continuous distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) measurements acquired over a 2553 m segment of a 26 km ocean‐bottom fiber‐optic cable offshore Zeebrugge, Belgium. It was specifically designed to support research in vessel detection and localization using DAS in  submarine cable protection applications.

The dataset was recorded between June 16–25, 2023 using an OptoDAS interrogator (using fs=3125 Hz and a gauge length L=10.21m). The raw differential strain phase signals have been converted into strain and windowed into non‐overlapping 10 s frames. For each frame, power spectral density was computed over 100 logarithmically spaced bands (following a data driven design strategy) between 4 Hz and 98 Hz (excluding 48–52 Hz), yielding a 250 × 100 "energy‐band” feature matrix per timestamp.

Ground‐truth labels for vessel distance are provided via linearly interpolated AIS data aligned to each 10 s window. A continuous label (in meters) records the closest‐vessel distance, while a companion ship_info group supplies vessel attributes (type, length, beam). All timestamps are UTC, and three consistently noisy channels (indices 59–61) are zeroed by default. The complete dataset is packaged in HDF5 format (X, y, datetimes, and ship_info). A companion GitHub repository at https://github.com/UAH-PSI/das-vessel-detection provided additional details, example Python code for loading, splitting, and preprocessing, plus frequency‐band definitions.
